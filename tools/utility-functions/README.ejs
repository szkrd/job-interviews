# utils

Small **utility functions** that I end up writing multiple times.
The project uses `ts-jest`; most of these should not need the DOM.

- These code fragments are meant to be edited.
- Console calls should be replaced with a log implementation.
- Not all functions may have tests.

## list of files

Files are in TS, but they may not be implicit any safe.
If a file has a spec, then it is marked with ‚ú® (sparkles), if it has **disabled** `no-explicit-any`
then it is marked with a ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning). Very old or incomplete / now broken scripts are marked
with a üõë (stop sign).

<%#<!--%>
<% files.forEach(file => { -%>
- <%= file.dirs %> / [<%= file.name %>](<%= file.fullPath %>) <%= file.hasSpec ? '‚ú®' : '' %><%= file.hasAny ? '‚ö†Ô∏è' : '' %><%= file.isBroken ? 'üõë' : '' %>
<% }); %>
