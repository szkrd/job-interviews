# utils

Small **utility functions** that I end up writing multiple times.
The project uses `ts-jest`; most of these should not need the DOM.

- These code fragments are meant to be edited.
- Console calls should be replaced with a log implementation.
- Not all functions may have tests.

## list of files

Files are in TS, but they may not be implicit any safe.
If a file has a spec, then it is marked with ✨ (sparkles), if it has **disabled** `no-explicit-any`
then it is marked with a ⚠️ (warning).

<% files.forEach(file => { -%>
- <%= file.dirs %> / **<%= file.name %>** <%= file.hasSpec ? '✨' : '' %> <%= file.hasAny ? '⚠️' : '' %>
<% }); %>
