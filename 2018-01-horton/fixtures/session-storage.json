Just use the component definition in HTML, everything goes well in both IE and Chrome (like the example running in jsfiddle).\r\n\r\n2.

What problem does this feature solve?\r\nTake a child component (through the default slot) and recursively clone it allowing the user to define a child \"sample\" in a declarative way. Consider for example the following template declaration:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<formset-manager>\r\n  <formset-row>\r\n    <formset-input name=\"aSampleInput\"></formset-input>\r\n    <formset-input name=\"anotherSampleInput\"></formset-input>\r\n  </formset-row>\r\n</formset-manager>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"formset-manager\" component takes a \"formset-row\" definition as an \"example\". Internally it should clone as many \"formset-row\" components as the user demands (Note that not only a plain \"formset-row\" component should be cloned but its children as well, that means that the sample provided should be cloned recursively). I was unable to get or build a clean solution for this use case using scoped slots. I believe that the solution for this use case implies that the user needs to fully implement a the render function for the \"formset-manager\" component.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe proposed API could look something like this (for the following template also consider the previously described \"formset-manager\" template):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst template = `\r\n    <div>\r\n        <div>        \r\n            <cloneSlot v-for=\"(row, rowIndex) in rows\"\r\n                :initial-data=\"row\"\r\n                :row-index=\"rowIndex\"\r\n                :show-delete-row-button=\"showDeleteRowButton(rowIndex)\"\r\n                :formset-prefix=\"formsetPrefix\"\r\n            ></cloneSlot>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <button type=\"button\" v-on:click=\"addRow()\" v-if=\"showAddRowButton()\">Add</button>\r\n    </div>\r\n`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe key to the above example is the proposed \"cloneSlot\" directive. For the above shown example it takes a \"formset-row\" child and clones it an arbitrary number of times (in this case dictated by the v-for). The \"rows\" used in the \"cloneSlot\" is defined in \"data\" (so when \"rows\" changes the appropriate number of \"formset-rows\" are cloned/generated).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

But if these take arbitrary values rather than just, say, class names, the child component then must use `style` attributes to apply the values. Unfortunately, this litters the `<template>` markup with style information. Also, the `style` attribute cannot be used to assign CSS properties to pseudo-elements like `:hover` and `:before`, which significantly limits the properties a component can expose to the caller for custom styling.\r\n\r\nThe only workaround is for the parent's CSS to override the child's CSS, but that requires the parent's CSS to be coupled to the child's implementing markup. The same value (or variants based on it, such as lighter or darker shades of a color) may be used in a number of selectors, complicating this effort, and if the component uses scoped CSS or highly-specific selectors, it may be even more difficult to override.\r\n\r\nCSS variables are now fully supported by every common browser other than IE11. So, I'm proposing that Vue support mustache syntax in the `<style>` block of SFCs where CSS variables are declared, and that Vue set and react to changes to these values by using the DOM's `style.setProperty` method.\r\n\r\nThis will allow component authors to provide props for more styling decisions, in a way that is still as reactive as using the `style` attribute, but with more capabilities (for pseudo-elements) and a tidier template. Internally, components can also use this to make styling decisions, including for pseudo-elements, based on computed values, all fully reactive. \r\n\r\nHere's an example of a component that does support CSS variables as properties, but has to wire it up manually with a watcher:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/richardtallent/vue-stars/blob/master/src/VueStars.vue\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to support IE <= 11 by replacing variables in the style with values and replacing the generated style tag as needed.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nThe API would simply be that the <style> block accepts mustache syntax in the declaration of CSS variables, and that behind the scenes, it reacts to changes by using the `style.setProperty()` method to update the CSS variable's value.\r\n\r\nFrom the component author's perspective:\r\n```HTML\r\n<template>\r\n  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"ColorHeader\",\r\n  props: {\r\n    bg: { type: String, default: \"inherit\", required: false },\r\n    bgHover: { type: String, default: \"inherit\", required: false },\r\n    title: { type: String, default: \"(Untitled)\", required: false },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<style>\r\n:root {\r\n   --bg-color: {{ bg }};\r\n   --bg-hover-color: {{ bgHover }};\r\n}\r\n  h1 { background-color: var(--bg-color); }\r\n  h1:hover { background-color: var(--bg-hover-color); }  \r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne down side I see is that this would require Vue's compiler to parse the CSS so it recognizes the variable name before the mustache, which could be a problem when using CSS that needs a pre-processor. So here's an alternative implementation:\r\n\r\n- Vue supports mustache syntax *anywhere* within the style block, but it is understood that it should *only* be used for CSS values, not the names of properties or selectors.\r\n- Vue makes no attempt to parse the CSS other than to find the mustaches.\r\n- For each discrete mustache expression, Vue replaces the mustache syntax with a CSS variable declaration at the top (auto-named) and `var(--auto-named-variable)` where the mustache syntax appeared.\r\n- Vue then just needs to update the value for the names it created reactively.\r\n- This would be compatible with any CSS variant that allows CSS variable syntax (and that doesn't replace it or the mustache syntax with something else).\r\n\r\nIf mustache syntax causes too much of a headache with linters, IDEs, etc. (since curly braces are important to CSS), a third alternative would be for the component author to use the CSS variable syntax, and require that if you want Vue to reactively set and update that variable, you simply use the kebab-case version of one of your data, prop, or computed attributes (i.e., no complex expressions or direct use of methods). Example:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<template>\r\n  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>\r\n</template>\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: \"ColorHeader\",\r\n  props: {\r\n    bgColor: { type: String, default: \"inherit\", required: false },\r\n    bgHover: { type: String, default: \"inherit\", required: false },\r\n    title: { type: String, default: \"(Untitled)\", required: false },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n<style>\r\n  h1 { background-color: var(--bg-color); }\r\n  h1:hover { background-color: var(--bg-hover); }  \r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo prevent collisions between real legacy variables and same-named component features, this could be opt-in with an attribute on the style element (like \"scoped\" operates).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.

short updates on the progress bar (in 4.0.0-beta.3) causes unexpected and ugly behavior due to the built-in [css transition on the progress bar](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/671bb27/scss/_progress.scss#L23).\r\n\r\nThis happens when using a jQuery `animate()` or `TWEEN` (or anything) for **short tweens**. \r\n\r\nThere is no bootstrap-friendly way of turning off the progress bar forced css transition, short of overriding the class, which makes it a poor choice for short progress transitions.\r\n\r\nI suggest having the css transition be an optional class on the progress bar, instead of built into it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith the css transition enabled, running a 3 second animation is sluggish and ends way before the end of the progress bar: \r\n\r\n![progress-with-transition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/438465/35183840-0defc602-fdb2-11e7-9f03-976080b5acb2.gif)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it drags behind what the percentage is, and then ends long before the 100%. If I don't set the width back to 0 at the end, it leaps from around 70% to 100% at the end of the tween.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter disabling the css transition it animates properly:\r\n\r\n![progress-without-transition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/438465/35183877-85d0b67c-fdb2-11e7-9c01-b00db27e944d.gif)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"progress\">\r\n  <div id=\"progressBar\" class=\"progress-bar\" role=\"progressbar\" style=\"width: 0%\" aria-valuenow=\"0\" aria-valuemin=\"0\" aria-valuemax=\"100\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n$(\"#progressBar\").css(\"width\", \"0\")\r\n$(\"#progressBar\")\r\n  .animate({\r\n    \"width\": 100 + \"%\"\r\n  }, {\r\n    duration: 3000,\r\n    step: function(now) {\r\n      $(this).text(Math.ceil(now) + \"%\")\r\n    },\r\n    complete: function() {\r\n      $(this).css(\"width\", \"0\")\r\n    }\r\n

Each FormGroup in the array has subscriptions like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // get the rides so we can iterate over them\r\n  get myRides(): FormArray {\r\n    return this.ridesForm.get('rides') as FormArray;\r\n  };\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  trackByFn(index, item) {\r\n    return index; // or item.id\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n // each ride that is added has subscriptions\r\n  subscribeChanges(ride: FormGroup){\r\n\r\n    ride['dateSub$'] = ride.get('date').valueChanges.subscribe(val => {\r\n     });\r\n    \r\n    ride['distanceSub$'] = ride.get('distance').valueChanges.subscribe(val => {\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    ride['startCountSub$'] = ride.get('start_count').valueChanges.subscribe(val => {\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    ride['endCountSub$'] = ride.get('end_count').valueChanges.subscribe(val => {\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow.. you can also delete FormGroup's using:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // deletes a single ride\r\n  public deleteRide(ride: FormGroup, i: number): void{\r\n        this.unsubscribeChanges(ride);\r\n       this.myRides.removeAt(i)\r\n}\r\n  unsubscribeChanges(ride: FormGroup){\r\n    ride['dateSub$'].unsubscribe();\r\n    ride['distanceSub$'].unsubscribe();\r\n    ride['startCountSub$'].unsubscribe();\r\n    ride['endCountSub$'].unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n````\r\n\r\nbut it seems that the tracking of objects goes wrong.. So let's delete a FormGroup at index 3 of 6 FormGroups....The subscriptions on the index of your removed FormGroup - and below that - do not fire anymore. As if their binding is still on a 'old' index. \r\n\r\nIs it not allowed to put your Subs$ on a FormGroup? Or is there a bug in the tracking / refreshing of FormGroup's in the array? \r\n"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/21681","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/21681/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/21681/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/issues/21681/events","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/21681","id":290180692,"number":21681,"title":"feat(compiler): fix #19878, can config zone in HostListener decorator","user":{"login":"JiaLiPassion","id":1442575,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1442575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion","html_url":"https://github.com/JiaLiPassion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JiaLiPassion/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":149476251,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/labels/cla:%20yes","name":"cla: yes","color":"009800","default":false}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2018-01-20T10:03:54Z","updated_at":"2018-01-21T15:08:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/angular/angular/pulls/21681","html_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/21681","diff_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/21681.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/21681.patch"},"body":"## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n```\r\n[ ] Bugfix\r\n[x] Feature\r\n[ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n[ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n[ ] Build related changes\r\n[ ] CI related changes\r\n[ ] Documentation content changes\r\n[ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n[ ] Other...

PR adds support for the `afterContentInit` and `afterContentChecked` hooks to render3. It also adds some missing tests for how projected components will work with other lifecycle hooks.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n - `afterContentInit` and `afterContentChecked` hooks are queued in `LView.contentHooks` during `elementEnd()`, then called after embedded views are processed in the first `r()` run of the view.\r\n   - These hooks can't be called in the existing`Comp.h()` or `Comp.r()` functions if we want to maintain a backwards-compatible call order. Init hooks must *all* be called for a specific view before calling any content hooks and all content hooks must be called for a view before any of its children. \r\n   - Because `afterContentInit` hooks are called in a slightly different order than `onInit`, we cannot use simply queue the hooks in `Comp.h()` either (as we did with `afterViewInit` in `Comp.r()`). To ensure the content hooks for projected components are executed first, we queue the hooks in `elementEnd`. \r\n- `afterContentInit` hooks are \"spliced\" out of the `contentHooks` array after the first run, using the same algorithm used for the view hooks. This trades a bit more time in creation mode to avoid iterating over \"dead\" hooks in every change detection run.\r\n- To fix `onDestroy` call order with projected components, `onDestroy` declarations have been moved out of the factory function and into `elementEnd` as well.
