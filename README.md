# Card component

## [Specification](https://www.notion.so/Card-component-206dfb9d6ba34e56b98853f4e0387701)

In this task you will be required to implement a configurable `card` component based on the given design.
You can find the option details in the design, but think of it as a real life project and make your component flexible:
implement it in a way that new features or design changes can be easily added / removed later on.
You can break the component into smaller ones too.

### Design

[https://www.figma.com/file/7nSuhkrcrSKtzuAlOSAeRf/Card-component?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/7nSuhkrcrSKtzuAlOSAeRf/Card-component?node-id=0%3A1)

### Requirements

- Implement the design
- Use semantic HTML
- Consider accessibility
- Support latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge browsers and IE 11+
- Mobile friendly
- Don't use any other component library / framework

### End goal

In the end we would like to see 4 different card variations below or next to each other on a page:

- one card must display every option, the rest is up to you, but make sure they're all different
- make sure we can see the loading state on them
- make sure to implement different click actions on the cards: clicking on one of them should alert or log a message, clicking on another should take you to another page / site, and clicking on another one doesn't do anything
- make sure this page is responsive (but you decide how you display the cards on it, you don't need to place them in a grid system)

### Technical details

For the project use Vue/Nuxt.js as your framework. Upload your finished project to the GitLab repo we created for you, and let us know when you're finished.
